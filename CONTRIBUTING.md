# Contributing to Laravel Eden 🍏

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Laravel Eden! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you
make will benefit everybody else and are greatly appreciated.

## Code of Conduct 📜

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the Laravel Eden Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [project_email@example.com].

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!! ❓

If you have questions about how to use Laravel Eden, please direct these to our community channels rather than the issue tracker. This will get you support much faster, and it reduces the workload on
our maintainers. The issue tracker is primarily intended for bug reports and feature requests.

## What we are looking for 🕵️‍♂️

Laravel Eden is an evolving project, and we are always looking for improvements and enhancements. We are interested in various contributions, including but not limited to:

- Bug reports
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Feature requests
- Feature implementations
- Test improvements

## Ground Rules 📏

Responsibilities

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in terms of quality, functionality, and guidelines.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Getting started 🚀

Contributions to Laravel Eden follow this workflow:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Commit changes to your own branch.
4. Push your work back up to your fork.
5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

## How to report a bug 🐛

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [project_email@example.com] instead.

In order to have a clear and efficient bug report process, we ask that you follow these guidelines:

- Check the documentation and the issues on GitHub to ensure the bug has not already been reported.
- Clearly describe the issue you encounter, including the steps to reproduce the bug and, if possible, a code snippet or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not
  occurring.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement 💡

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Laravel Eden, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list
on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process 👀

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any
activity.

## Community 🌎

Discussions about Laravel Eden take place on this repository's Issues and Pull Requests sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Where possible, we use GitHub to directly support communication about the project.
